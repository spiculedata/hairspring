# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- The run page's activity panel shows each event as a titled line with labelled facts instead of raw JSON, with the raw
  event behind a "Raw event" disclosure.
- `scripts/check-embedded-ui.sh` checks that a release binary serves the web UI built from the repository's `web/`
  source, and fails on an older UI. The release workflow runs it after each binary is built, `make release` runs it
  after the build, and `make check-ui` runs it on its own.

### Changed

- `hairspring confirm <run-id> --json` now prints a JSON array with one entry per failure of the run. It used to print
  a single object. `hairspring confirm <failure-id> --json` and `hairspring confirm <bundle> --json` still print one
  object. Scripts that read the output for a run id need to read the first entry of the array, or loop over it.
