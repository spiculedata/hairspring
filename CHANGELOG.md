# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- A Hermit bundle records hashes of the target's command line and working directory (`target.command.sha256`,
  `target.cwd.sha256`; no paths or arguments are stored). Replay warns when either differs, still runs from the current
  configuration, and a miss then exits 3 (inconclusive). Older bundles replay as before and say the fields were not
  recorded.
- The run page's activity panel shows each event as a titled line with labelled facts instead of raw JSON, with the raw
  event behind a "Raw event" disclosure.
- `scripts/check-embedded-ui.sh` checks that a release binary serves the web UI built from the repository's `web/`
  source, and fails on an older UI. The release workflow runs it after each binary is built, `make release` runs it
  after the build, and `make check-ui` runs it on its own.

### Changed

- The `not rated trials:` line in the text report of a search run or a sweep now says how many inconclusive trials
  showed a failure, counted once per trial. Those failures stay out of the hits and the rate. The count is stored
  with the run's property summary. A run with no stored property summary has an unknown count, and the line says
  nothing about it; summaries written before the count existed read it as 0. The count is a lower bound: it covers
  only timed-out trials whose events were read, and leaves out failures the run did not attribute to a stored per-id
  field, including ids dropped by the id cap. In a sweep the "N inconclusive" figure also includes unusable trials.

- A foreground command (`hairspring test`) now leases only the job of the run it started. It no longer runs, or marks
  as running, an older queued job of another run, such as one left behind by an earlier command that was killed with
  `kill -9`. Such jobs are left to workers (`hairspring worker`).
  The same applies to the MCP `start_run` tool when the server runs runs inline (`hairspring mcp`, which runs runs in
  its own process): it leases only the job of the run it starts, so it no longer runs other runs' queued jobs.
- `hairspring confirm <run-id> --json` now prints a JSON array with one entry per failure of the run. It used to print
  a single object. `hairspring confirm <failure-id> --json` and `hairspring confirm <bundle> --json` still print one
  object. Scripts that read the output for a run id need to read the first entry of the array, or loop over it.
